# Binomial-Option-Pricing-Model
The binomial option pricing model is an options valuation method developed in the 1970s by economists John Cox, Stephen Ross, and Mark Rubinstein.
It breaks down the life span of an option into discrete periods, assuming that the price of the underlying asset can only move up or down by a certain amount in each step, creating a "binomial tree" of possible price movements.   
This technique used to value options by simulating possible paths the underlying asset's price could take over the option's life and is particularly useful for valuing American-style options, which can be exercised before expiration since it evaluates the best exercise times. 
The model becomes more accurate as the number of time steps increases, eventually converging with the Black-Scholes model in the limit of infinite steps.

I also experimented this method in google sheets. The link is attached below.

I have taken help of various resources available online to do the project. Playlists of Binomial Option Pricing model available on youtube such as those of Mehul Mehta and Ryan Oâ€™Connell along with many more have been tremendously helpful.
